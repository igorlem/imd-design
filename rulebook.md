# iMusician design platform stepbook

## Value

• Ordinary Styleguide gets away, this is more flexible tool
• Design rules are atomic now, including tone of voice, text labelling, colors, fonts etc.
• Resources are grouped together and easily accessible for anyone

## Steps

1.  Design Resources Platform MVP
2.  Information Architecture
    (Design Card, how many groups/sections, how to group resources)
    ((More advanced design here))
3.  GUI / Script to publish updates without using code editor
4.  Publish under imusician domain e.g. `design.imusician.com`

## Notes

• For now, we can use it on github pages (e.g. `github.com/imd-design`)
